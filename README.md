    ## Observation
    ---
    From the report above,it is observerd that the organisation has more male attrition count than female,Also the employees with the educational field life sciences has the highest attrition count and human resources has the lowest attrition count, we can also say that the sales department has the highest count when we mesure the attrition by department,followed by R&D, then HR having the least attrition count 

  ## Recommendation
  ---
  I would recommend that the sales department having the highest atrition rate should be looked into by the management of the organisation, Areas like their salary,working environment,work ergonomics should be considered
